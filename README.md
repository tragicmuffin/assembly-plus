# A+ (Assembly+)

A+ is an extremely simple programming language made to practice writing a compiler/interpreter.  
- See **[Aplus.md](https://github.com/tragicmuffin/assembly-plus/blob/master/Aplus.md)** for the documentation of the A+ language.
- **aplus2py.py** is an interpreter written in Python that runs an A+ program by translating lines into Python.
